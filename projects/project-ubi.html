                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>Ubi Interactive's main product is software that turns any surface into a multi-touch display using the Microsoft Kinect sensor (Note: They have since started producing their own hardware). They were interested in moving into the education space, but many educators reported having trouble during the installation process. In a team of 4 we conducted numerous usability studies, and provided recommendations to Ubi, all of which were implemented.</p>
                
                <h2>Problem Space</h2>
                <p>When users are introduced to new technologies the installation can pose a large barrier. We specifically wanted to understand obstacles K-12 educators with limited technical expertise, time, and IT support face when installing and setting up Ubi for the first time.</p>
                <p>How might we improve the installation process to ensure successful use in the classroom?</p>
                
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>We conducted a total of ten usability tests in the field with teachers in their classrooms. Before the start of each test we pre-configured all hardware, asked participants a series of pre-task questions, prompted them with the actual task, and finally asked some post-task questions.</p>
                
                <p>Each participant was asked to complete a single task: install and setup Ubi for the first time.  Participants found Ubi very compelling and were willing to deal with issues along the way. During the task, users were very successful during the majority of the installation screens; however, they had trouble initially downloading and starting Ubi and later had issues with the unique Ubi calibration experience.</p>
                
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>We provided Ubi with a number of recommendations, all of which they fully implemented. Those recommendations include (1) Provide clear instructions and action-oriented wording and coloring throughout the installation process. (2) Send only the application after purchase and not the numerous and overwhelming guides. (3) Update the purchase email text to only include necessary information. (5) Remove Kinect type screen, and determine this through hardware.</p>
